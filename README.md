PrescryptoWars.js
===========

A pharma-dealing game set in latam during 2021.

## About

This game was inspired by the UNIX rewrite of the MS-DOS program Dope Wars, which in turn was inspired by John E. Dell's "Drug Wars" game. Yup, that game has a long history. Though it's probably the first one to implement drug-consuming.

## License

This game is licensed under the MIT license.
